        <h2><em>What is drivetalk</em>?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong><em>drivetalk</em></strong> is a <strong>narrative-driven</strong> game about a taxidriver's introspective journey through <strong>grief</strong>
            presented through <strong>conversations</strong> with passengers.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Inspired by <strong><em>VA-11 Hall-A</em></strong>, <strong><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em></strong>, and the anime <strong><em>OddTaxi</em></strong>
            we aim to create an emotionally impactful game that leaves the player <strong>'sitting in silence afterward'</strong> and reflecting on their own experiences.

            Show canva ideas
            gameplay looperton

            original game was 
            currently iterating on gameplay loop since we've recieved a lot of feedback that it is easy to miss dialogue and
            dashboard interactions feel more like a chore than like the fun multitasking we aimed for

            new version of gameplay will put conversations first. Players will store words from dialogue
            and use those words to get new dialogue from passengers.

        <h2><em>Narrative Design</em>:</h2>
        <p>
            I wrote Quinton and proofread/gave feedback on the dialogue for other characters.
            Came up with the idea of a character to help allow our somewhat silent MC to talk more (Romeo convo).
