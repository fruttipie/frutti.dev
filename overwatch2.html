        <h2><em>Who is ScrapMouse?</em></h2>
        <p>
            <strong>ScrapMouse</strong> is an Overwatch 2 hero that I created during my 2023 internship at Blizzard.
            She will <strong>NOT</strong> be released in Overwatch 2 as far as I know.
            She is a medium-range DPS/damage hero who wields a homemade nail gun with a rebar launcher on top.
            I wanted players to feel like a nimble, scrappy hero whose power snowballs as she continues to do more damage.
            She is also a chaos-loving gremlin who named herself after Junkrat <em style="font-size: 1rem;">(Junk = Scrap, Rat = Mouse ... get it?)</em>.
