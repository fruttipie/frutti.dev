        <h2>What is a Hero Designer?</h2>
        <p>
            In <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>, a <strong>Hero Designer</strong> creates
            the gameplay mechanics and abilities for the many playable <strong>heroes</strong>.
            An Overwatch 2 hero typically has inherent <strong>parameters</strong> such as Health and Ammo, <strong>4 to 6 active abilities</strong>, <strong>in-match upgrades</strong> called "perks,"
            a <strong>passive ability</strong>, and one game-changing <strong>ultimate ability</strong>.
            Every Overwatch 2 hero has situations that <strong>allow the player's skills to shine</strong> and others that intentionally <strong>create challenges</strong>.

        <h2>Who is ScrapMouse?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>ScrapMouse</strong> is an Overwatch 2 hero that I created during my 2023 Hero Design Internship at Blizzard.
            She is a <strong>medium-range DPS</strong> hero who wields a homemade <strong>nail gun</strong> with a <strong>rebar launcher</strong> on top.
            My intended player fantasy was that of a <strong>nimble</strong>, <strong>scrappy</strong> hero whose power snowballs as she continues to do more damage.
            <br>She is also a chaos-loving gremlin who named herself after Junkrat
            <br class="onlyOnMobile"><em style="font-size: 1rem;">(Junk = Scrap, Rat = Mouse ... get it?)</em>.
