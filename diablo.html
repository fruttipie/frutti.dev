        <h2><em>Season 7 Witchcraft Powers</em></h2>
        <h3>My Design Cycle looked like:</h3>
            <li><h4>> UNDERSTAND GOALS</h4></li>
                Our intention with these Season 7 Witch powers was to create visually impressive, lore-rich, impactful powers
                that players could really <em>feel</em>.
                I understood this to be our goal after speaking with Narrative Designers, VFX, and the Design Lead for the season.
            <li><h4>> RESEARCH</h4></li>
                My first step was to look back at past seasons to see what we did right and wrong.
                I aimed to find what made past seasons' powers feel impactful, so we could
            <li><h4>> BRAINSTORM</h4></li>
                My goal is to get as many ideas down as quickly as possible, let them 'marinate',
                and then revisit them later to see if they have merit.
            <li><h4>> IMPLEMENT PROTOTYPES</h4></li>

            <li><h4>> PLAYTEST</h4></li>
                I led numerous internal playtests with playtesters from different disciplines and game expertise.
            <li><h4>> ITERATION</h4></li>
                Using the feedback we received from playtesting, I iterated upon my existing designs.
            <li><h4>> BACK TO RESEARCH!</h4></li>
                With iteration comes more research, brainstorming, implementation, and playtesting!
                This cycle keeps happening over and over until we've got the feel and balance <em>just right</em>.

        <h2><em>Spiritborn Paragon Glyphs & Nodes</em></h2>
        <p>
            My first project while on the Diablo Class Design team was to make 4 Paragon Glyphs for the then unreleased class, Spiritborn.
            I worked alongside another designer to create Glyphs that supported different existing playstyles.
            This project helped me to get familiar with scripting in Diablo's proprietary engine.
            I also named most of Spiritborn's Paragon Glyphs and Rare Paragon Nodes.
